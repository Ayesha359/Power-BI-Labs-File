# üìä Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard: Adventure Works Analysis üöÄ

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing sales performance and key business metrics, likely using a dataset similar to the well-known **Adventure Works** sample data. The project demonstrates the creation of an interactive and insightful dashboard designed to visualize sales trends, profitability, and customer behavior.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive view of sales operations, enabling stakeholders to:

* **Track Sales & Profitability:** Monitor overall revenue, profit margins, and order quantities over time.
* **Analyze Geographic Performance:** Understand sales distribution and performance across different countries/regions.
* **Evaluate Product Categories:** Identify top-performing product lines and their contribution to business success.
* **Explore Customer Demographics:** Gain insights into sales patterns based on customer attributes (e.g., gender, age group - *inferred from previous requests*).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling, transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.
* **[Dataset Source]**: (e.g., SQL Server, CSV files, Excel workbooks - *specify if known, otherwise keep generic*) - Likely an Adventure Works-style dataset.

## üìà Dashboard Features & Visualizations

The dashboard includes several key pages and interactive visualizations:

### Page 1: Overview (or Sales Summary)

* **Sales and Profit Margin by Month**: A combination chart (line and column) showing monthly sales trends and profit margins, allowing for easy identification of peak seasons and profitability fluctuations.
* **Sales by Country and Category**: A bar chart (or similar) visualizing sales performance broken down by geographical regions and product categories, highlighting regional strengths and popular product types.
* **Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Order Quantity Cards**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) providing an at-a-glance summary of overall business health.

### Page 2: [Add another page if your project has one, e.g., "Customer Analysis" or "Product Deep Dive"]
